Questions:
	Will the domain contain the students choices (student as a class)?
	Will the model account for teachers being a limited resource and assignable only to some cources (Class instead of simple attribute)?
	Should the model account for overlapping cources (credits may vary if other cources are selected)?
	Should the model account for changing cources within a program from year to year (Cource code as ID or concat code with year)?
		If so; what can change without the cource code changing?
		Is version int, float or string (1, 1.0, 1.0.1)? 
		Can i student be under multiple departments?

Answers:
	Focus on modelling of the plan not the choices that the student might make.
	The student is not inherintly connected to a department, the courses are and teachers are but not student.
	The allocation of teaching resources will not be modelled.
	The model should account for changes over years.
